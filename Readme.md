# [memtest_vulkan](https://github.com/GpuZelenograd/memtest_vulkan/blob/main/Readme.md) - GPU memory testing tool

Opensource tool written in vulkan compute to stress test video memory for stability during overclocking or repair.
Developed as an alternative to OpenCL-based tool [memtestCL](https://github.com/ihaque/memtestCL)

Just start application, wait several minutes and stop testing by Ctrl+C. Detected errors are displayed immediately during test run. Though the image below gives detailed descriptions for errors table - actually it is not needed for 90% of uses. Just run tool and see if errors are absent or present.

[Prebuilt binaries for windows and linux, including aarch64 NVidia Jetson](https://github.com//GpuZelenograd/memtest_vulkan/releases/)

Requires system-provided vulkan loader and vulkan driver supporting Vulkan 1.1 (they are installed with graphics drivers on most OS).
Also requires support of `DEVICE_LOCAL+HOST_COHERENT` memory type from the compute device.

## Usage examples

Windows version can be started by double-click

The example above was stopped by Ctrl+C after showing first error.

Example windows run from cmdline without errors:

## Troubleshooting & reporting issues

If the test fails to start and shows `memtest_vulkan: INIT OR FIRST testing failed due to runtime error` for a compatible GPU there is some incompatibility
in vulkan installation. If multiple ICD's are install a specific one may be specified by setting environment variable like `VK_DRIVER_FILES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/nvidia_icd.json`.
Also try running with root/admin privileges - this is sometimes required on headless devices.

If this doesn't help - enable verbose mode by renaming the executable to `memtest_vulkan_verbose` and running again. The test will output diagnostic information to stdout - please copy it to a new issue at https://github.com/GpuZelenograd/memtest_vulkan/issues.

## Memory error kinds (theory)

* The single-bit errors like in an [image above](#usage_screenshot). Such errors are counted in ToggleCnt column 0x01 and the exact bit indices are counted in SingleIdx column. Such errors may be detected by EDC in theory if they occur during transmitting by EDC-enabled part of GPU<->memory wire. But I'm not sure if EDC helps if they occure when transmitting between gpu cache and gpu core or something like this.
* The errors on data-inversion bit (if not detected by EDC). Those should be counted in ToggleCnt columns 0x07/0x08 without SingleIdx info for them.
* The multi-bit transmission errors. Those should be counted in ToggleCnt columns above 0x01, without SingleIdx info for them.
* The errors flipped in the memory chips itself during data storage/"refresh cycles". This may be caused by too big period of refresh or other problems. memtest_vulkan uses a part of memory in a "write once at start but reread everytime" pattern - it is the reason fot read GB is more then written GB. If a data flips inside this part of memory - there would be infinite log of error messages marked with "Mode NEXT_RE_READ" (in oppposite to Mode INITIAL_READ). Lowering the clocks without restarting test doesn't get rid of such errors.
* The errors on the address-transmission bus. The metest_vulkan is designed to perform reads to the non-sequential series of medium-sized sequential blocks. And if the address is wrongly interpreted by a memory chip - the result is completely garbage from wromg cell. Data-bus EDC can't help here. Those errors typically gives completely random error patterns with normal distribution of bits count and flipped bits (so typical number of flipped bits are 12-20 of 32 and getting 1 flipped bit for this case is extremely unrelalistic). The result looks like
```

```
* Other critical errors inside memory chips or memory controller. This gives normal distributions for TogglCnt, but for 1sInValu the distribution may be different - since critical internal errors may be reported by some fixed patterns (0x00000000, 0xFFFFFFFF - for some EDC problems, 0x0BADAC?? - for some nvidia problems).
* Memory errors in the areas where error counts are stored)) This often shows as millions of errors in all table entries, typically with the total errors greater then tested memory size. Such results are numerically garbage but means that the gpu/memory is really mostly non-functional.
* The errors in GPU during calculation of addresses and desired values or in value comparison. This can lead to the any pattern of reporting at all, since the logic of program is broken.
